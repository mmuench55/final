      <h2>Take Notes</h2>
      <p>Whether you take seperate notes or write comments in your code, it's important to keep notes of what you did. Later on when you're trying to do something similar for a different site it'll come in handy to know how you did it!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Look at Inspiration</h2>
      <p>Check out other websites for inspiration and try to see if you can think of how you would write the HTML for practice. Look at other people's codes too! Don't just copy it, though, see how you could use it to improve your own and expand on it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Sketch and Make Mocks</h2>
      <p>Give yourself some guidance when you're coding. It's much easier to work based off a sketch or mock up than trying to come up with it from scratch.</p>

      <h2 id="be">Be Patient</h2>
      <p id="last">It can be frustrating to not be able to get your website to look how you want right away. Be patient and keep things simple at first! You'll get better.</p>
